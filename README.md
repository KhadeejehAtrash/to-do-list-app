# Angular To-Do List App

## What this app does

This is a simple To-Do List application built with Angular standalone components.  
Users can:
- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Delete tasks  

The app demonstrates basic Angular concepts such as component state management, two-way data binding with `ngModel`, and usage of `CommonModule` and `FormsModule`.

## What I changed or added

- Created the `AppComponent` as a standalone Angular component.  
- Implemented functions to add, toggle completion, and delete tasks.  
- Used Angular's `FormsModule` to enable two-way data binding for the task input.  
- Imported `CommonModule` to support directives like `*ngFor`.  
- Managed state locally inside the component for simplicity.  
- Set up multiple commits during development to track progress.

## Challenges faced

- Understanding and configuring standalone components in Angular, especially adding necessary imports (`CommonModule`, `FormsModule`).  
- Fixing errors related to `ngModel` binding and structural directives like `*ngFor`.  
- Learning to properly configure Git and GitHub, including push and remote URL setup.  
- Making sure commit history shows correctly on GitHub.
